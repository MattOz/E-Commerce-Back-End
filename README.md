## Description
In this project I built the back end for a sample e-commerce site. It uses a working Express.js API to use Sequelize which interacts with a MySQL database.

With e-commerce being a large part of the economy and an important skill to learn as a web developer, this project helped me learn understand the fundamental architecture of these platforms.
